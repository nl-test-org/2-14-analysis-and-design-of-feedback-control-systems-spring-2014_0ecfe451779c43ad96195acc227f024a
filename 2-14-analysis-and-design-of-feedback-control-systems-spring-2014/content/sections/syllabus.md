Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Labs: 1 sessions / week, 3 hours / session

Recitations (graduate students only): 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Description
-----------

This course develops the fundamentals of feedback control using linear transfer function system models. Topics covered include analysis in time and frequency domains; design in the s-plane (root locus) and in the frequency domain (loop shaping); describing functions for stability of certain non-linear systems; extension to state variable systems and multivariable control with observers; discrete and digital hybrid systems and use of z-plane design. Students complete an extended design case study. Students in the graduate version (2.140) attend the recitation sessions and complete additional assignments.

Roberge, James K. [_Operational Amplifiers: Theory and Practice_](/resources/res-6-010-electronic-feedback-systems-spring-2013/textbook). John Wiley & Sons. 1975.  
This book is available as a free electronic textbook from Prof. James Roberge and MIT OpenCourseWare.

Readings from the textbook are listed in the [Readings]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) section.

Laboratory Sessions
-------------------

Students attend one of three [lab sessions]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/labs) each week. Each session meets for three hours. Each lab session concludes with a one-on-one check-off with one of the course teaching assistants. The lab grade is based upon the check-off (50%) and a written lab report (50%). Students will receive a grade of zero for missed lab session.

Assignments
-----------

Weekly [problem sets]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments) are due each week in lecture. No late problem sets will be accepted except in extenuating circumstances. Students in the graduate version of the course (2.140) are assigned extra problems. Undergraduate students are welcome to work these, but no extra credit is given.

Random Lecture Assignments
--------------------------

During lecture, the course staff will regularly assign problems for students to solve, either in lecture, or due the following lecture. Solutions will be graded, and the total of the results is worth 5% of the final course grade.

Recitations
-----------

Students in the graduate version of the course (2.140) are required to attend an hour long recitation session held after their lab session. This session covers material unique to 2.140.

Quizzes
-------

Two closed-book quizzes will be given. There are no laboratory sessions during the weeks of quizzes. The quizzes are closed-book. One sheet of notes will be permitted in Quiz 1. Two sheets of notes will be permitted in Quiz 2. Calculators may be used, but no more advanced computational tools are allowed, i.e., no MATLABÂ®, LabVIEW, Mathematica, etc. Any requested plots will need to be sketched by hand.

Design Project
--------------

A final [design problem]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/design-project) will be assigned in the last two weeks of the course. This problem will allow you to apply the topics covered in the course to a realistic design problem. Students must work individually on this problem; only course staff can be consulted with questions.
